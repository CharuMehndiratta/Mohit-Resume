              <h3 class="c-article__header">Gaussian Process-based Learning Control of Aerial Robots for Precise Visualization of Geological Outcrops</h3>
              <p class="c-article__text">Generating 3D field models, commonly known as virtual outcrops, is getting increasingly popular amongst geoscientific researchers. While an aerial robot is often employed for the mapping process that involves taking a series of overlapping images, the manual data collection gets challenging due to various reasons, namely: 1) piloted flight over a straight path for outcrops having curved/uneven surface results in distorted images due to consistent auto-focusing, 2) wind disturbances make it difficult even for skilled pilots to precisely maintain the desired overlap, and 3) hiring of a skilled pilot is expensive as the outcrop generation requires hours of data collection. To tackle these challenges, we propose to fully automate the data acquisition process in this work. In that vein, firstly, the designed navigation algorithm takes care of the trajectory generation for mapping. Whereas, the proposed learning-based control framework, i.e. position tracking nonlinear model predictive controller in conjunction with Gaussian process-based disturbance regression, facilitates a precise tracking of the generated path. Thanks to the long-short term memory feature of the designed GP model, the disturbance forces are accurately estimated even for increasing magnitude levels and time-periods. </p>

              <h3 class="c-article__header">Automated Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller.</h3>
              <p class="c-article__text">The non-trivial weight tuning process is a major concern for safe realtime implementation of model predictive controller (MPC) especially over aerial robots. In most cases, users prefer the trial-and-error method to obtain these weighting parameters either on a real robot or in simulation. Whereas the former might be dangerous – especially with aerial robots –, the latter requires an accurate system model. To overcome these challenges, this work presents an active exploration-based tuning methodologythat significantly reduces the time and effort for MPC implementation and hence, can be fairly useful for unskilled MPC users. Besides, it utilizes a high fidelity deep neural network (DNN) model of the aerial robot that circumvents dangerous trials over real robots; while being real flight worthy at the same time, which facilitates their direct deployment over the real robots. Furthermore, to cater for several operational uncertainties – decreasing battery voltage, communication delays – that may not be captured within the DNN model, fine-tuning of the weight sets is also performed over the real robot. This essentially demonstrates the real flight tuning feasibility of the proposed algorithm.</p>

              <p class="c-article__text">To overcome the limitations of a traditional feedback linearrization control (FLC) method, this work presents a simple learning (SL) strategy to facilitate accurate tracking of aerial robots in unknown/uncertain environments. The SL strategy updates the controller gains and disturbance estimate within the feedback control law by minimizing a cost function which is defined based on the closed-loop error dynamics of the nominal system. The stability of the proposed approach is proven for a second-order uncertain nonlinear system. Also, it is illustrated that the SL strategy can find the global optimum point, and the controller gains and disturbance estimate converge to a finite value, thus resulting in a bounded control signal at the steady-state. </p>

              <p class="c-article__text">In accordance with the goal of utilizing aerial robots for daily operations in real application scenarios, an aerial robot must learn from its own experience and its interactions with the environment. This work presents an instantaneous learning-based control approach for the precise trajectory tracking of a 3D-printed aerial robot which can adapt itself to the changing working conditions. Considering the fact that model-based controllers suffer from lack of modeling, parameter variations and disturbances in their working environment, we observe that the presented learning-based control method has a compelling ability to significantly reduce the tracking error under aforementioned uncertainties throughout the operation. Three case scenarios are considered: payload mass variations on an aerial robot for a package delivery problem, ground effect when the aerial robot is hovering/flying close to the ground, and wind-gust disturbances encountered in the outdoor environment. In each case study, parameter variations are learned using nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) method, and the estimated parameters are fed to the nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). </p>

                  <p>In recent years, Autonomous Cars have been developed rapidly and even have been put on US roads without a safety driver by Waymo (the autonomous vehicle division of Alphabet, Google’s parent company) in 2017. However, there are still some problems need to be discussed and solved in order to let everyone to accept this new concept transportation. In my URECA project, I am going to scale down the autonomous car by using an RC car and simulate the scenario in real word such as overtaking, line detection, traffic sign recognition and so on. In this method, I would like to get more familiar to how a autonomous vehicle works and how to improve its performance and functionality.</p>

                  <h4>Fly Without Borders with Additive Manufacturing: A Microscale Tilt-Rotor Tricopter Design (2017 - 2018 AY)</h4>
                  <p>During a rescue mission, multicopters offer safe surveillance, mapping and delivery of light supplies to the inside of a collapsed structure for an outside rescuer. For greater functionality, the multicopter should be agile and small enough to maneuver tight spaces, and customized to carry necessary electronics to meet operational requirements. Bearing a smaller propeller area and superior flight dynamics over other multicopters, a 3D-printed microscale tricopter offers a customizable, lightweight, and compact solution to this setting. As such, this project explores a lightweight and fully customized fabrication of a 3D-printed microscale tricopter. Considering the features and flight electronics required, the microscale tricopter frame is designed and optimized in SOLIDWORKS to compactly incorporate the electronics with minimal parts. For the desired strength and durability, the parts are printed with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) in the CUBICON 3D Printer. Tri-blade propellers are also used for a smaller blade area to keep the system compact. These methods produce a successful and stable micro-scale tri-copter weighing 519g and sizing 176mm (Radius) by 10mm (Height). Furthermore, we also demonstrate its tracking control in an indoor motion capture environment utilizing a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, which is implemented on an on-board Raspberry Pi 3 embedded processor.</p>

                  <h4>Dual Rotor VTOL Fixed-wing UAV with 3D Printing (2017 - 2018 AY)</h4>
                  <p>Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) combines the advantages of fixed wing aircrafts and rotary aircrafts – the fixed wings guarantee high aerodynamic efficiency while the VTOL capability reduces reliance on runway. We have built a dual rotor VTOL fixed-wing UAV with two rotors by using additive manufacturing technology (also known as 3D Printing) as the primary manufacturing method. The high strength and rapid prototyping features of 3D printing are utilized in our design to achieve adequate structural strength without inducing weight penalties. The dynamics and control of the UAV in both VTOL mode and fixed-wing mode have been analysed and implemented to achieve ideal flying qualities. Multiple prototypes have been developed and flight tests have been conducted to verify the design and the feasibility of 3D Printing in manufacturing VTOL UAVs.</p>

                  <h4>Fabrication and Real-Time Testing of a Tilt-Rotor Tricopter (2016 - 2017 AY)</h4>
                  <p>The goal of this project is to design and manufacture a lightweight unmanned tricopter that can autonomously perform a series of manoeuvres in an enclosed test range with high degree of safety and reliability. Using computer aided design and engineering simulation software, the tricopter is designed to be robust and lightweight. The tricopter will be manufactured using a combination of 3D printed ABS plastic and woven carbon fibre prepregs to guarantee a high degree of reliability during experimental flights. In order to obtain accurate data for the experiment, a motion capture system is utilised to capture precise movements of the tricopter and relay the readings to a main control computer over Wi-Fi. The obtained data is used as feedback for the Raspberry Pi computer fixed on board the tricopter, which then sends adjustment commands to the craft to achieve the desired manoeuvre/position</p>

                  <h4>Design and Manufacturing of a Tilt-Rotor Bicopter Experimental Setup (2016 - 2017 AY)</h4>
                  <p>The initial phase of this project is to first design an experimental setup needed in order to house and securely mount a bicopter which is to be used in later stages to run tests to determine the flight controls. The design of the experimental setup (cage) should allow for the yaw, roll and pitch features of the bicopter. 2 design perimeters are implemented into the design of the experimental bicopter that involves both the oblique tilting feature (maximum tilting angle of 30 degrees) and also a tilting feature of the motors along the lateral axis of the bicopter. CAD drawings are initially drafted to produce a virtual design of the entire setup. Multiple manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and several CNC machining steps are involved in the production of the setup. Upon successful production of the setup and bicopter, flight control inputs are inputted into the PixHawk to perform test to determine the flight responses from the experiments. Such evaluation of the flight responses are determined and obtained via torque measurements. Hence the main motivation behind this project is first to utilize any available manufacturing processes to produce a tangible experimental setup and also to study on how the effect of the oblique tilting features influences the flight responses of the bicopter.</p>

                  <h4>Design and realization of a twin rotor system (2015 - 2016 AY)</h4>
                  <p>This final year project presents a Twin Rotor System model with the application of PIXHAWK and MATLAB Simulink®. Mechanical design on Twin Rotor System experiment setup will be reviewed based on several Basic Design Rules and Embodiment Design Principles. Besides, components involved in the architecture of circuitry for Twin Rotor System experiment setup will also be described in detail. The purpose of designing Twin Rotor System is to establish a data acquisition experiment setup. In this 1 degree of freedom Twin Rotor System experiment setup, control on Roll – angle are interested. System model of Twin Rotor System will be constructed by means of MATLAB Simulink®. PID tuning of Twin Rotor System which gives the most pleasing response are recorded and the appropriateness of Twin Rotor System response will then be evaluated by plotting graphs of angular displacement over time</p>

                  <p>The initial phase of this project is to build a tricopter and provide concepts, dynamics and control strategies of the UAV. After building the physical drone, mathematical modeling and analysis of the tricopter is done with the aid of parametric equations of motion and identification. The secondary objective describes the modeling and simulation of the coaxial tri-rotor UAV using Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results are presented and the effects of controller parameter variation and external disturbance components are discussed.</p>

                  <h4>Design and realization of a tilting mechanism (2015 - 2016 AY)</h4>
                  <p>In terms of cost effectiveness and power efficiency, tricopter is better than other Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. However, tricopter control and stability is more challenging compared to even numbers configuration such as quadcopter. Since it has odd number of propellers, tricopter utilizes tilting mechanism for yaw rotation. Main focus of this research will be about tilting mechanism and yaw rotation. All the systems tested on this experiment is mounted to the ground to avoid injuries for the researchers or to the UAV. To achieve this, Twin Rotor Multi Input-Multi Output (TRMS) system is developed for early control testing. Mounting for general UAVs is also developed to test control design of any UAV. UAV mounting constraints translational movement of a UAV and reduce the desgree-of-freedom into 3 for rotational movement.</p>
